Sure, here's a basic example of how you can set up a Next.js project with routing. 

First, you need to install Next.js, React and React-DOM. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

This will create a new Next.js application in a directory called `my-app`. You can replace `my-app` with the name of your application.

Next, navigate into your new project's directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

Now, let's create some pages. In Next.js, routing is based on the file system, so you can create routes by creating `.js` files in the `pages` directory.

For example, let's create a `home` page. Create a new file in the `pages` directory called `home.js`:

`home.js`
```javascript
import React from 'react';

const Home = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Home Page</h1>
  </div>
);

export default Home;
```

And let's create an `about` page. Create a new file in the `pages` directory called `about.js`:

`about.js`
```javascript
import React from 'react';

const About = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>About Page</h1>
  </div>
);

export default About;
```

Now, you can navigate between these pages using the `Link` component from Next.js. Let's add some links to the `index.js` file:

`index.js`
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Link from 'next/link';

const Index = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Index Page</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <Link href="/home">
          <a>Home</a>
        </Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link href="/about">
          <a>About</a>
        </Link>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
);

export default Index;
```

Now, if you run your application with `npm run dev`, you should be able to navigate between your `home`, `about`, and `index` pages.

Please replace `my-app` with your preferred application name and `stubuser` and `stubpassword` with your actual username and password.
